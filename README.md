# Website for a singer

An over engineered website for my sub-profession of "opera singer". It is
styled using Bootstrap and uses AngularJS to pull down a static json file which
contains information about all the shows I've ever done. Under the heading of
"Upcoming" it enumerates all shows which are not yet complete. Under a second
heading of "Resume" it displays a secondary list of roles which are worth
mentioning. The ids of these shows are hard coded into the JavaScript. All
other shows are ignored.
